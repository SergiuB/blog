### What programming is and is not

Not about being the best. No ninja. No guru. Some reach that status, but probably not by focusing on it, but on doing what they love.

For me it is about improving. About discovery. About finding problems to solutions, and the other way around.
Sometimes it's not even about solutions or usefulness, but merely a good pastime, like playing an instrument, taking calligraphy courses, or working with wood. And that's reason enough for me to practice it.

Besides being a programmer Iâ€™m a parent, husband, friend, colleague, reader, adventurer, endurance sports enthusiast, and the list might go on. So balance has to be found. I try hard at it, failing most of the time in one area or another, but that's ok.
